<h1>Drop your weapon and pull out your god damn pick-axe!</h1>
</br><hr/>
<h2>Since you have a bit of the gryffindor pride you decided not to run, You pull at your pickaxe and the other person drops the sniper rifle. Ruh-Ro! You lost the pick-axe fight since he was jumping to dodge and you were crouching to doge and since you can't move as much when you crouch, you got hit 10 times while the other player only got hit 4 times resulting in you being blugeoned to death.</h2>
